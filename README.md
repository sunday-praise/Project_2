# Overview
Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and
understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for
data analysts.

The data sourced from Luke Barousse's Python Course which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on
job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded
skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python
libraries:
        1. Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data.
     2. Matplotlib Library: I visualized the data.
     3. Seaborn Library: Helped me create more advanced visuals.

- Jupyter Notebooks: The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- Visual Studio Code: My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis

# Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.




# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3
most popular data roles. I filtered out those
positions by which ones were the most popular, and
got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This
query highlights the most popular job titles and
their top skills, showing which skills I should
pay attention to depending on the role I'm
targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
        df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc
        ['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5) [ ::- 1]
        sns.barplot (data=df_plot, x='skill_percent',
        y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count',
        palette='dark:b_r')

plt.show()
```

### Results

### Insights

- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded
across all three roles, but most prominently for
Data Scientists (72%) and Data Engineers (65%).
- SQL is the most requested skill for Data
Analysts and Data Scientists, with it in over half
the job postings for both roles. For Data
Engineers, Python is the most sought-after skill,
appearing in 68% of job postings.
- Data Engineers require more specialized
technical skills (AWS, Azure, Spark) compared to
Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected
to be proficient in more general data management
and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).

# The Analysis

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data
Analysts?

### Visualize Data

```python

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

df_plot = df_DA_US_percent.iloc[:, :5]
sns. lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False,
legend='full', palette='tab10')

plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter
(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.show()
```

### Results

![Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the US](Images\output.png)
*Bar graph visualizing the trending top skills for
data analysts in the US in 2023.*

### Insights:
- SQL remains the most consistently demanded skill
throughout the year, although it shows a gradual
decrease in demand.
- Excel experienced a significant increase in
demand starting around September, surpassing both
Python and Tableau by the end of the gear.
- Both Python and Tableau show relatively stable
demand throughout the year with some fluctuations
but remain essential skills for data analysts.
Power BI, while less demanded compared to the
others, shows a slight upward trend towards the
year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data
Analysts?

### Salary Analysis for Data Nerds

#### Visualize Data

```python
sns.boxplot (data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg',
y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt. FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int
(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
```

#### Results

![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US](Images\Salary_Distribution.png)
*Box plot visualizing the salary distributions for
the top 6 data job titles.*

### Insights
- There is a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist
positions tend to have the highest salary
potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high
value placed on advanced data skills and
experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist
roles show a considerable number of outliers on
the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting
that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead
to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data
Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in
salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority
and specialization of the roles. Senior roles
(Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not
only have higher median salaries but also larger
differences in typical salaries, reflecting
greater variance in compensation as
responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data
#### Insights:

- The top graph shows specialized technical skills
like dplyr', 'Bitbucket', and 'Gitlab' are
associated with higher salaries, some reaching up
to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical
proficiency can increase earning potential.

- The bottom graph highlights that foundational
skills like 'Excel', 'PowerPoint', and 'SQL' are
the most in-demand, even though they may not offer
the highest salaries. This demonstrates the
importance of these core skills for employability
in data analysis roles.

- There's a clear distinction between the skills
that are highest paid and those that are most
in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their
career potential should consider developing a
diverse skill set that includes both high-paying
specialized skills and widely demanded
foundational skills.


## 4. What is the most optimal skill to learn for
Data Analysts?

#### Visuaļize Data

``` python
from adjustText import adjust_text
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand
['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand
['median_salary'])
plt.show()
```

![Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US](
Images\optimal_results.png)

*A scatter plot visualizing the most optimal
skills (high paying & high demand) for data
analysts in the US.*

#### Insights:
- The scatter plot shows that most of the
`programming` skills (colored blue) tend to
cluster at higher salary levels compared to other
categories, indicating that programming expertise
might offer greater salary benefits within the
data analytics field.

- Analyst tools (colored green), including Tableau
and Power BI, are prevalent in job postings and
offer competitive salaries, showing that
visualization and data analysis software are
crucial for current data roles. This category not
only has good salaries but is also versatile
across different types of data tasks.

- The database skills (colored orange), such as
Oracle and SQL Server, are associated with some of
the highest salaries among data analyst tools.
This indicates a significant demand and valuation
for data management and manipulation expertise in
the industry.
